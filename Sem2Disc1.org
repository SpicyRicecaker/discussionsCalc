#+TITLE: Semester 2 Discussion 1 Ideas/Working
#+DESCRIPTION: Ahh, can't think of an idea for the graph to choose...

* Examples
  | Graph              | Specifics                    | Integral Calculations         | Meaning                  |
  |--------------------+------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------|
  | Speed v Time       | Speed(m) / Time(s) / Time(s) | m / s * s = m (Distance)      | Total Distance Traveled  |
  | Temperature v Time | Temperature(c) / Time(s)     | c * s = cs (Temperature-Time) | Total Temperature Change |
  |                    |                              |                               |                          |

* Trying to Make Sense
  1) This makes sense.
  2) I don't think this means anything.

* Therefore, We Would Preferably Have a *Rate* as our Initial Graph...
  - Wait! We can just convert the damage reduction (%) per armor into armor-damage reduction *efficiency*. Then use this damage reduction efficiency to calculate the total armor?
